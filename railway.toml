# railway.toml
# This file defines multiple services within a single Railway project

[[service]]
name = "backend"
root = "backend/backend"
build = { dockerfile = "Dockerfile" } # Path to Dockerfile relative to 'root'
deploy = { startCommand = "java -jar app.jar" }

[[service]]
name = "frontend"
root = "frontend"
# No specific build/deploy commands needed here as Vercel will handle the frontend.
# This entry primarily helps Railway understand the monorepo structure.
